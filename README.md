Tripsg is a full-stack application with both server and client versions. The backend is built using the Slim 3 framework, which provides a REST API. For the front end, Guzzle is used to retrieve data from the server. The project is hosted on an AWS Linux instance, and MySQL serves as the database management system. In the client version, Twig is employed to create a user-friendly interface, similar to React. The application includes basic CRUD operations, search functionality, and user information tabs.
